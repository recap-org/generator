The results are broadly consistent with intuition. In particular:

1. prior performance is strongly predictive of current exam outcomes,
2. attendance is positively associated with scores, and
3. study time has a modest but precisely estimated effect.

For completeness, we note three features of the empirical setup:

- __Measurement.__ All variables are measured at the individual level.
- __Illustration.__ The sample is purely illustrative.
- __Linearity.__ The specification is intentionally linear.
