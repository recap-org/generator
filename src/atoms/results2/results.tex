The results are broadly consistent with intuition. In particular:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item prior performance is strongly predictive of current exam outcomes,
  \item attendance is positively associated with scores, and
  \item study time has a modest but precisely estimated effect.
\end{enumerate}

For completeness, we note three features of the empirical setup:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Measurement.} All variables are measured at the individual level.
  \item {\bf Illustration.} The sample is purely illustrative.
  \item {\bf Linearity.} The specification is intentionally linear.
\end{itemize}
